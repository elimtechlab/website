## Welcome to the Curriculum Center Hub! 

This website was created by the Curriculum Center in order to provide an online presence that will be used for a variety of reasons. 

Some of these reasons include: 
- Distribution of new information
- Linking to useful resources
- Making it easy to schedule collaboration time with the Curriculum Center staff
- (Eventually) Providing the ability to check-out or reserve materials and technology  

Please take a look at the sidebar for some of the resources we currently have available!

## Seesaw - End of Year Procedure
At the close of ESY, we will be required to follow the Seesaw end-of-year procedures in order to prepare for the 2021-2022 school year. These procedures require us to **purge all current classrooms**. 
 
## This means that: 
- All of the studentsâ€™ work will be archived (it will no longer be visible to staff, students, or families).
- All current classrooms will be deleted, and new classrooms will be created based on the 2021-2022 roster. 
- All staff-created activities will remain in their personal library -- these activities will NOT be deleted.

## What does this mean for teachers and therapists?
1.	Teachers will need to send home each student's new login code via email or postal mail.  
2.	Any co-teachers (such as therapists) will need to be re-added to the new classroom.

*Please reach out to the Curriculum Center staff with any questions!*
