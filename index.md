## SOPPA
Per Illinois law, websites that collect student data are now required to have a valid [SOPPA](https://ltcillinois.org/services/dataprivacy/) agreement on file with each school. If a website does not have a valid SOPPA agreement, then the school staff are not allowed to enter any of the students' [personal identifiable information](https://www.iasb.com/about-us/publications/journal/2020/january-february-2020/legal-matters-ready-or-not/). 

If the name of the website is not listed [**here**](https://sdpc.a4l.org/district_search.php?state=IL&districtID=10896), please contact [irene.yuska@elimcs.org](irene.yuksa@elimcs.org) for further guidance.
