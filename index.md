## Seesaw End-of-Year Procedures (7/20/21)
**At the close of ESY**, we will be required to follow the Seesaw [end-of-year procedures](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide "https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide") in order to prepare for the 2021-2022 school year. These procedures require us to purge all current classrooms. 

This means that: 

-   All of the students’ work will be archived (it will no longer be visible to staff, students, or families).
-   All current classrooms will be deleted, and new classrooms will be created based on the 2021-2022 roster. 
-   **All staff-created activities will remain in your personal library – the activities in your library will not be deleted.**

What this means for you?

1.  Teachers will need to send home each student's new login code via email or postal mail at the start of Fall 2021.

## SOPPA (8/11/21)
Per Illinois law, websites that collect student data are now required to have a valid [SOPPA](https://ltcillinois.org/services/dataprivacy/) agreement on file with each school. If a website does not have a valid SOPPA agreement, then the school staff are not allowed to enter any of the students' [personal identifiable information](https://www.iasb.com/about-us/publications/journal/2020/january-february-2020/legal-matters-ready-or-not/). 

If the name of the website is NOT listed below, please contact [irene.yuksa@elimcs.org](irene.yuksa@elimcs.org) for further guidance.
