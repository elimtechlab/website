## Seesaw End-of-Year Procedures (7/20/21)
**At the close of ESY**, we will be required to follow the Seesaw [end-of-year procedures](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide "https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide") in order to prepare for the 2021-2022 school year. These procedures require us to purge all current classrooms. 

This means that: 

-   All of the students’ work will be archived (it will no longer be visible to staff, students, or families).
-   All current classrooms will be deleted, and new classrooms will be created based on the 2021-2022 roster. 
-   **All staff-created activities will REMAIN in your personal library – the activities in your library will not be deleted.**

What this means for you?

1.  **Teachers will need to send home each student's new login code via email or postal mail at the start of Fall 2021.**

3.  Any co-teachers (such as therapists) will need to be added to your new classroom.
