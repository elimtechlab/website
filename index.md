## Seesaw End-of-Year Procedures (7/20/21)
**At the close of ESY**, we will be required to follow the Seesaw [end-of-year procedures](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide "https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/115000452783-End-of-year-guide") in order to prepare for the 2021-2022 school year. These procedures require us to purge all current classrooms. 

This means that: 

-   All of the students’ work will be archived (it will no longer be visible to staff, students, or families).
-   All current classrooms will be deleted, and new classrooms will be created based on the 2021-2022 roster. 
-   **All staff-created activities will remain in your personal library – the activities in your library will not be deleted.**

What this means for you?

1.  Teachers will need to send home each student's new login code via email or postal mail at the start of Fall 2021.

3.  Any co-teachers (such as therapists) will need to be added to your new classroom.
