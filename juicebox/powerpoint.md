[Office365 Powerpoint](https://www.office.com/launch/powerpoint?auth=2)

### Here are two examples of what the books can look like... but feel free to be creative! You know your students better than anyone. 
*These files have been saved as PDFs for easy viewing.* 
[What Is A Desert?](../files/Desert.pdf)
[Desert Animals](../files/DesertAnimals.pdf)

If you haven't used Powerpoint before, you're going to need to play around with the controls and practice using the software in order to learn. Please reference the [Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet](../files/TroubleshootingHandout.pdf") if you're stuck.
