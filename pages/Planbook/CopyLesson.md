### Copying Another Teacher's Lesson
Once you've been added to someone's classroom, you can copy their lessons. 
1. Select `Copy` at the top left of the schedule screen.
2. Under *Copy From* select `Lessons` > `Lessons`
3. Select `From` > and then choose the appropriate teacher.
4. Select the current school year.
5. Select the specific class you want to copy.
6. Enter the start date and click `Show Lessons`
7. Under *Copy To* select **your** class you'd like to copy the lesson into.
	- If you haven't yet created the class, you can do so now. You'll need to create your own class before you can copy the lesson from another teacher. 
8. Now simply drag the classes from left to right and choose `Copy` when prompted.  

_That's it! You should now have their lesson plan in your schedule._
